                     posted on CPSC 223 website, googling for how to end
                     the process of scanf and how to use " or ' in the
                     equation in C.

The first problem I found was how to end the scaning process, for the
"while(!scanf())" is not working to stop correctly when it finishes reading the
file. And I stuck for a while finding that the " and ' can not use as a single
character in "" or ''.
